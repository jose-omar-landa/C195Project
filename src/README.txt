Running the program:

When the program is first started, the user will encounter a login screen. A username and password that exists
within the database must be entered correctly in order to access the application. Once logged in, the first screen
the user will encounter is the Appointment Schedule View that will initialize showing all scheduled appointments.
The user may use the radio buttons on the bottom left corner to filter appointments by the current week or by
the current month. The bottom of the screen has buttons allowing the user to add, update, or remove an appointment
from the schedule. On the right bottom corner, there are buttons for the Customer Directory Screen and for the
Reports Screen.

The Customer Directory Screen has a table showing all the current customers within the directory. The bottom of
the screen has buttons allowing the user to add, update, or remove a customer from the directory. At the bottom
right of the screen, there is a button that allows the user to go back to the Appointment Schedule View Screen.

The Reports Screen allows the user to generate the following reports:
1. A report showing the total number of customer appointments by type and month.
2. A report showing a schedule for each contact in your organization that includes appointment ID, title, type
   and description, start date and time, end date and time, and customer ID.
3. A report showing each appointment scheduled by each User ID, which can allow an audit of who created each
   appointment.
